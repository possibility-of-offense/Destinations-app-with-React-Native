At 2300 metres above sea level, Val Thorens is commited to innovate and create unique memories. You won't find 'traditional' here, because Val Thorens has never done things like the others. Val Thorens owes this exceptional reputation above all to its location: Val Thorens has achieved the impossible by becoming the highest ski resort in Europe, and the largest ski area in the world with over 600 kilometres of runs. The resort was essentially created for one reason and one reason only: to offer the best skiing which you can't find anywhere else. Vincent Lalanne, director of Val Thorens",

Our guide, Hassan, was very friendly and knowledgeable. He taught us so much about the culture and the sites we visited. Must do! Don’t skip this.",

I love the ocean and very much enjoyed the beach and loved seeing the turtles while paddle boarding, A friend took a similar bus trip in the past and was the inspiration for this trip. I only had one full leisure day on Oahu and no car. Hope to be back again soon.",
