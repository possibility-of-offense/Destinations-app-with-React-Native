At 2300 metres above sea level, Val Thorens is commited to innovate and create unique memories. You won't find 'traditional' here, because Val Thorens has never done things like the others. Val Thorens owes this exceptional reputation above all to its location: Val Thorens has achieved the impossible by becoming the highest ski resort in Europe, and the largest ski area in the world with over 600 kilometres of runs. The resort was essentially created for one reason and one reason only: to offer the best skiing which you can't find anywhere else. Vincent Lalanne, director of Val Thorens",
