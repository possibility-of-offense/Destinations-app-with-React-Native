# Important notice

The app has no persistance at all for now. The data is being loaded from .json file.
The "adding reviews" functionality is adding the reviews in memory through React Context API.
Because of the no-persistance nature of the app, the "register" functionality has to pick an image url through copyclipboard from an array of image urls.
